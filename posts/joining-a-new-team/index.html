<p>Joining a new team is challenging. You&rsquo;re the new person on the team, you&rsquo;re unproven, you don&rsquo;t know anyone, and you might not know what you&rsquo;ll be working on. Overall, there&rsquo;s just a lot of ambiguity. Having a base strategy and a couple clearly defined goals can help ensure the transition is a success.</p>
<p>As a new team member, the primary goal should be acceptance within the team. I think the best first strategy to accomplish this is not always obvious: listen and observe. As Stefan Covey said: Seek first to understand, then to be understood. You don&rsquo;t need to be an overachiever and prove yourself initially, obviously you should still work hard, but make sure you&rsquo;re putting in effort to understand the team. Thus:</p>
<h3 id="goal-1-understand-the-climate">Goal 1: Understand the climate</h3>
<p>What is the team dynamic? Does the team work excessively hard? are they a bunch of lazy hippos? What is the culture like? What brand of humor do they have? If the team has been together for awhile, then you&rsquo;ll be an outsider at first but you can likely find support from within the team. If the team is new, then it&rsquo;s possible nobody really knows what they&rsquo;re doing and it may take awhile to settle in. Either way, you need to identify the current processes and how the team will function together. Most importantly, avoid ostrisizing yourself. This is <strong>NOT</strong> the time to make suggestions. Save the suggestions for later when you know more. This is especially true for teams who have been together for awhile. The team likely hasn&rsquo;t accepted you yet, and now you&rsquo;re trying to enact change. It&rsquo;s likely the team has already iterated through a number of changes to get to their current process (which seem to be working fine), and you don&rsquo;t know the history of <strong>why</strong> they do something a certain way. Besides, most people don&rsquo;t want change. While you may feel leadership will appreciate your changes, likely the team will not. Instead, focus on your energy on your current tasks and doing them well.</p>
<h3 id="goal-2-add-value-to-the-team">Goal 2: Add value to the team</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple, show up and do your work. You don&rsquo;t need to be an overachiever, but make sure your work is high quality and continue working towards being self sufficient. If you have questions it&rsquo;s important to ask for help, but make sure you try solving the problem on your own first. Don&rsquo;t ask questions that have an easily searchable answer on google, it&rsquo;s a waste of your teammate&rsquo;s time and it doesn&rsquo;t look good on you either. Instead, when you ask question, explain the steps you took to try answering the question already. Take notes of where teammate&rsquo;s get their answers and write it down. If it&rsquo;s from inside their brain, it&rsquo;s tribal knowledge: write it down. If they have to ask another person, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll want to get to know that person too: write down their name and the solution. This will prevent you from having to ask the same question twice, since you can reference your notes first.</p>
<h3 id="goal-3-being-accepted-into-the-team">Goal 3: Being accepted into the team</h3>
<p>This goal usually takes time, and it&rsquo;s a gradual process. A good sign that you&rsquo;re on the right track is when members of the team start sharing inter-team troubles and complaints with you. Most people are reluctant to share complaints with someone they don&rsquo;t trust, so this shows you&rsquo;re building rapport and trust with the team. In my experience, this is the best indicator that you&rsquo;re on the way to being accepted into the team.</p>
<h3 id="strategy">Strategy:</h3>
<p>Using these goals we can create a strategy to reduce the risks, stresses and challenges of joining a new team. The strategy can be summed up into 4 focus points: do your work well, ask high quality questions, avoid ostricizing yourself and be patient.</p>
